I've been on this journey as a full stack developer, working on various web applications like Booking Systems, E-commerce Apps, Data Filtering and Visualization Dashboards, Geographic Information System Applications, etc. Every project sent me back to the React documentation, learning new concepts each time.

In my pursuit of mastering the technologies I use, I wondered whether only developing extensive projects is the most efficient approach. Though implementing large projects undeniably provides invaluable experience and pushes boundaries, an intermediate step that could help is a focused study of technical concepts before diving into massive projects. This method involves implementing concepts in smaller-scale mini-projects, similar to the structure of high-quality online courses.

The "React Hooks Series" is a bunch of upcoming blog posts, each highlighting a specific React hook. Each post will showcase the various use cases for the featured hook and demonstrate these applications through a mini-project.

These blog posts aren't a walk-through of all of React from square one. Instead, the goal is to help anyone grasp the different use cases of React hooks through real-world examples. By challenging yourself to apply a single hook to several scenarios, you'll be better equipped to apply that knowledge to larger, more complex projects.

In summary, striking a balance between large-scale projects and adopting a focused learning approach via hands-on experience is crucial in learning tech. The React Hooks Series explores the intricacies of the React hooks, one mini-project and blog post at a time, helping you elevate your proficiency in React.
