summary: 'Exploring React Hooks through Mini-Projects.'
---

I've been on this journey as a full stack developer, working on various web applications like Booking Systems, E-commerce Apps, Data Filtering and Visualization Dashboards, Geographic Information System Applications, etc. Every project sent me back to the React documentation, learning new concepts each time.

The "React Hooks Series" is a bunch of upcoming blog posts, each highlighting a specific React hook. Each post will showcase the various use cases for the featured hook and demonstrate these applications through a mini-project.

These blog posts aren't a walk-through of all of React from square one. Instead, the goal is to help anyone grasp the different use cases of React hooks through real-world examples. By challenging yourself to apply a single hook to several scenarios, you'll be better equipped to apply that knowledge to larger, more complex projects.
