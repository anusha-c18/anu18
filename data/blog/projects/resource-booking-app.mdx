### Introduction

With multiple resources available in large-sized apartments, there are always conflicts in their usage and availability among the residents. Living in such an apartment myself made me realise that there is a simple solution to this trivial issue - a Resource Booking App.

### Key Features

As I sat down to list the requirements for this project and design its architecture, I wanted to integrate certain features and platforms to upskill. Listed below are the highlights of the project that I set out to achieve:

- Three-Tier Architecture: Frontend, RESTful API, Backend
- Client and Admin logins
- Admin’s functionalities - CRUD apartment resources
- Client’s functionalities - Book resources & view current and previous bookings

- For the frontend I used React, Framer Motion, React Router, React Hot Toast, and Vite, and deployed it on Vercel.

- I developed the RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js. To test the endpoints created I used Postman. To load test the API I used Apache JMeter. The RESTful API is deployed separately using Vercel.

- I engineered a database with three collections and hosted it on a cluster in MongoDB Atlas.

- For authentication, authorization: creating secure endpoints and Role-Based Access Control, I used Auth0.

#### Presentation Layer

This layer consists of the frontend that is accessible by the different kinds of users which include the clients & admin.

#### Application Layer

This layer consists of the RESTful API designed with several secure endpoints as detailed out in the image.

#### Database Layer

As the name suggests, this layer consists of the database, ‘resourceBooking’, with 3 different collections:

- allResources
- bookings
- users
